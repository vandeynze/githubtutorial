# test123
A simple toy repository for introducing Git/GitHub, testing/demonstrating features, etc.

## Learning objectives
1. Understanding of the purpose and use of core GitHub collaboration features
2. Ability to clone an existing repository locally, create a personal branch, and generate a pull request to update the original master

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your device.
2. Create a personal branch, make some edits, and commit.
3. Make a pull request!

### Examples
- **[Grant McDermott's `blueparadox` repository](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/blueparadox/):** This is a simple example of a "finished" repository for a specific publication. Grant (and co-authors) provide STATA and R code to replicate the figures and core results for McDermott, Meng, *et al.* (PNAS, 2018): ["The blue paradox: Preemptive overfishing in marine reserves"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802862115). It includes great READMEs in important places that clearly lay out the purpose and use of different components. Grant includes one [pull request](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/blueparadox/pull/1) as an update to address a comment on the original publication, highlighting a use-case for the branching/PR/merging features.
- **[Grant McDermott's `sceptic-priors` repository](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/):** In this example, Grant shares an in-progress analysis. The READMEs still do a good job of explaining what each piece does and how to execute the program. The repository includes several (now closed) [pull requests](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), including one [submitted by a student](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/pull/1). In this example, Grant reviews Alex's (@jungangl) branch at the point the PR was created (see the *[Files changed](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/pull/1/files)* page for the PR). On the *[Conversation](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/pull/1/#issue-192767509)* page, he asks Alex to make a few additional changes to ensure the repository still functions properly, demonstrating how the flow and structure of the Pull Request collaboration features.

### Tutorials
- **[Eli Holmes's "Practical Workflow for Scientists" series](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2020/):** Week 1 (basic intro to installing Git/GitHub/RStudio and getting them talking to each other), Week 2 (a guide to cloning someone else's repository), and Week 7 (merge conflicts and using branches effectively) are directly relevant to Git/GitHub best practices.
